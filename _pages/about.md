## Seeking PhD Position for Fall 2026 (Can Be Fully Self-Funded) and Unpaid Research Intern Starting Fall 2025

I am a second year MS computer science and engineering student at Santa Clara University. My advisor is professor [Yi Fang](https://www.cse.scu.edu/~yfang/). I received my bachelor's degree from University of California, Berkeley in 2021.

## Research Interests

I am interested in the following directions:

1. **Language Model Methods and Evaluation**: Developing and evaluating techniques to understand LLM/MLLM capabilities and limitations, including chain-of-thought reasoning, prompting strategies, retrieval-augmented generation, and mechanical interpretability approaches.

2. **AI Safety**: Investigating faithfulness, fairness, sycophancy, reward-hacking, and alignment issues in language models.

3. **Agents**: Exploring agent learning and reasoning, multi-agent systems, and human-agent collaboration.

## Schedule a Meeting

Feel free to schedule a meeting with me. I'm always eager to learn from others and discuss interesting ideas or potential collaboration opportunities.
